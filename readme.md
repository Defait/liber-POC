# Liber
Liber means "Book" in latin. This is a proof-of-concept.
## What is Liber
Liber is a place where any aspiring writer can post their short or long stories in an organisable easy to use fashion.
It allows aspiring writers to get people to read their books at zero costs and allows the users to easily follow developments to their favorite books.


# Liber v2
Liber v2 will be the spiritual successor to Liber v1. 
I aim to improve the data model, design(currently horrible) and user experience.
Feel free to send in issues with ideas or commentary, I need/want to improve.

## Improvements
* Books can be part of a series now.
* Subscriptions (to books/series) so you can track new chapter releases.
* Better UX and working writers hub.
* Book/Series information all stored in information table.
* Tracking of chapters read.
* Writer profiles/info

## Would like to do one day.
* Following writers would work the same as subscribing does on Twitch (you pay small amount, writer gets small amount)
* Android/iOS app
